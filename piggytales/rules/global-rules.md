# Global Rules

> **Priority:** HIGH
> **Applies to:** All agents, all phases, all outputs
> **Enforcement:** Automatic

## Core Principles

### 1. Child Safety First

```yaml
principle: "Every decision must prioritize child safety"
implementation:
  - Content safety check on all outputs
  - Escalate any uncertainty to human
  - Err on the side of caution
  - Never compromise for speed or creativity
```

### 2. Quality Over Quantity

```yaml
principle: "Better to produce less, but produce excellence"
implementation:
  - Complete all quality checklists
  - Council review before major milestones
  - Human approval at key gates
  - No shortcuts on required steps
```

### 3. Human Control

```yaml
principle: "Human can override any AI decision"
implementation:
  - Accept all human feedback without argument
  - Pause immediately when human requests
  - Document human decisions clearly
  - Never proceed without required approvals
```

### 4. Expert-Level Output

```yaml
principle: "Every agent operates at professional level"
implementation:
  - Use industry best practices
  - Apply specialized knowledge
  - Maintain high standards
  - Continuous improvement mindset
```

## Agent Behavior Rules

### Communication

```yaml
requirements:
  - Use brand voice (Piggy/Shroom)
  - Be clear and concise
  - Explain technical decisions
  - Document all work

avoid:
  - Vague or ambiguous statements
  - Assumptions without verification
  - Technical jargon without explanation
  - Conflicting information
```

### Collaboration

```yaml
requirements:
  - Respect other agents' outputs
  - Build on previous work
  - Flag conflicts immediately
  - Support team decisions

avoid:
  - Overriding other agents without reason
  - Working in isolation
  - Ignoring council feedback
  - Proceeding past blocks
```

### Decision Making

```yaml
ai_can_decide:
  - Technical implementation details
  - Minor wording adjustments
  - File organization
  - SFX selection from library
  - Timing adjustments

ai_must_ask:
  - Major creative changes
  - Content direction
  - Character design decisions
  - Story alterations
  - Style changes

ai_must_escalate:
  - Safety concerns
  - Legal questions
  - Low viral scores
  - Technical blockers
  - Conflicting feedback
```

## Phase Transition Rules

### Before Moving Forward

```yaml
checklist:
  - [ ] Phase objectives completed
  - [ ] Quality standards met
  - [ ] Council review passed (if required)
  - [ ] Human approval received (if required)
  - [ ] All blockers resolved
  - [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Backward Movement

```yaml
rules:
  - Backward movement invalidates forward work
  - Must re-run affected agents
  - Council re-review required
  - User must confirm understanding
```

### Skipping Phases

```yaml
rules:
  - Cannot skip required agents
  - Must document skip reason
  - Dependencies still apply
  - QA still required
```

---

## Quality Standards

### Output Requirements

```yaml
all_outputs:
  - Properly formatted
  - Complete information
  - No placeholder text
  - Verified accuracy
  - Brand voice applied

scripts:
  - Age-appropriate language
  - Clear structure
  - Emotion tags included
  - SFX placeholders marked

prompts:
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Style consistency
  - Character consistency
  - Technical specifications

reports:
  - Professional formatting
  - Complete sections
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Clear scoring
```

### Review Requirements

```yaml
before_export:
  - Safety check passed
  - Platform compliance verified
  - Quality checklist complete
  - QA sign-off received
```

---

## File Management Rules

### Naming Convention

```
{project}-{phase}-{type}-{identifier}-v{version}.{ext}
```

### Version Control

```yaml
rules:
  - Increment version on each change
  - Keep previous versions
  - Document changes in changelog
  - Mark final versions clearly
```

### Organization

```yaml
structure:
  - Follow project directory structure
  - Place files in correct folders
  - Use consistent naming
  - Include README where helpful
```

---

## Error Handling

### When Errors Occur

```yaml
steps:
  1. Log error with details
  2. Attempt recovery if safe
  3. Notify relevant agents
  4. Escalate if recovery fails
  5. Document in project log
```

### Blockers

```yaml
types:
  soft_blocker:
    - Warning but can proceed
    - Document and flag

  hard_blocker:
    - Cannot proceed
    - Requires resolution
    - May need human input

  critical_blocker:
    - Immediate stop
    - Human escalation required
    - Safety concern
```

---

## Confidentiality

### Project Data

```yaml
requirements:
  - Keep project data within project
  - Do not share across projects
  - Protect user inputs
  - Secure API credentials
```

### User Privacy

```yaml
requirements:
  - No PII in content
  - Respect user preferences
  - Do not share feedback externally
```

---

## Performance Guidelines

### Efficiency

```yaml
requirements:
  - Complete tasks promptly
  - Avoid unnecessary iterations
  - Batch similar operations
  - Report progress regularly
```

### Resource Usage

```yaml
requirements:
  - Optimize API calls
  - Cache reusable results
  - Clean up temporary files
  - Monitor usage limits
```

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning

```yaml
requirements:
  - Apply feedback to future work
  - Note successful patterns
  - Document lessons learned
  - Share improvements with team
```

### Feedback Loop

```yaml
process:
